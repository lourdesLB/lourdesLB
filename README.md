# Hi, I'm Lourdes Linares üëãüèΩ üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

<img src="./canva-lourdes.png">

I am a passionate student and researcher in Deep Learning and Data Science, currently working part-time with the [Minerva research team](https://grupo.us.es/minerva/) at University of Seville since last year. My research encompasses areas such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Time Series Forecasting, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). While I keep learning about Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Following this research role, I am a Graduate in Computer Engineering and also in Mathematics, where I gained a solid foundation in Optimization and Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey is marked by a continuous drive to align my education with my passion for data science and research. I am currently enhancing my academic credentials with a Master's in Data Engineering and preparing to embark on a Doctorate.

I am always eager to evolve and grow, both personally and professionally. Beyond my profound interest in research, I always keep an open eye for new opportunities to learn and acquire new skills. That is why I also find a great interest in other areas such as Software Development.
